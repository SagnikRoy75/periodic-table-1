                    <p>I ended up using online periodic tables a fair bit whilst studying Physics A-Level, none seemed quite good enough to me, the majority were outdated, clunky, and difficult to use. I decided to have a shot at making one myself, it seemed like a good opportunity to learn things and (hopefully) create a good resource for other people. This project has changed a lot since I initially started it (way back in 2011) but the goals have remained the same.</p>

                    <p>If you want a look at the source code, or want to report issues/suggest features please checkout the <a href="https://github.com/sean-dunwoody/periodic-table">GitHub page for this project</a>. I'd really appreciate help from anyone with a Physics-y background willing to help me plot the future of this project, if you think you're this person please <a href="http://sean.dunwoody.me/contact">let me know</a>!</p>
